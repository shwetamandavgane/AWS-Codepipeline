# AWS-Projects

This is a simple SpringBoot project developed with the goal of learning CI/CD pipeline using AWS 

Overview of architecture:
SpringBoot project -> Git -> CodeBuild -> S3 -> CodeDeploy -> EC2

<sub><sup>In my portfolio project built with AWS, I used AWS Lambda and AWS CodePipeline instead of CodeDeploy to build pipeline.
  Here I have used CodeBuild, CodeDeploy and EC2 to build this pipeline.</sup></sub>
