# AWS-Projects

This is a simple SpringBoot project developed with the goal of learning AWS CodePipeline 

Overview of architecture:
SpringBoot project -> Git -> CodeBuild -> S3 -> CodeDeploy -> EC2

##In my portfolio project built with AWS, I used AWS Lambda instead of CodeDeploy to build COdePipeline.
Here I have used CodeDeploy and EC2 to build CodePipeline.
