# AWS-Projects
   1) Project 1 - Basic AWS Code pipeline  --->  Git -> AWS CodeCommit -> CodeBuild -> S3 -> CodeDeploy -> EC2

In my portfolio project built with AWS, I had used AWs Lambda instead of CodeDeploy to build COdePipeline.
Here I have used CodeDeploy and appspec.yml to build CodePipeline.
